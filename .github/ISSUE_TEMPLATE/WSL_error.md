name: WSL Error on Launch
about: Create a report to help us improve

These WSL error messages occur time to time, are usually user-specific, and can be hard to pin down.
They are usually not an issue with WLinux but with the underlying Windows Subsystem for Linux in Windows 10.
You can help us help you and Microsoft improve WSL and address these if you can provide us some debugging information.
