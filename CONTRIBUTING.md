## Grants/Bounties

If you have an idea for a new feature you would like to see included and can implement, grants are currently available for $50-$250 based on complexity.

Your proposal will be evaluated for complexity, reasonableness, and whether it fits within scope of WLinux and WSL. You may see possible proposals [here](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLinux/labels/Possible%20Bounty). Your work sample will be evaluated to determine if you have the technical competancy to implement the proposed change. An ideal work sample would be an intermediate bash script performing some administrative task on Linux.

If approved, you will recieve a simple agreement covering the scope of the work which you must acknowledge and return, and then you may commence work. Note: WLinux and Whitewater Foundry will not pay for feature additions or pull requests that have not first been approved and subject to the terms of an agreement.
