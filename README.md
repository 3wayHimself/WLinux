## Background

WLinux is a Linux distribution ("distro") optimized for use on Windows Subsystem for Linux ("WSL"). While other distros are available for WSL, this is the first Linux distro specifically customized for use on WSL. A number of enhancements are enabled by default and additional improvements are planned. WLinux is open-source and based on the stable Debian GNU/Linux distro. Development occurs on GitHub. Pull requests, forks, and issues are welcome. A paid version is planned for the Microsoft Store to fund future development, including bug/feature bounties.
